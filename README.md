# Read me

This is  a repository of 10 apps that I will be building from Ardit Sulce's Python Mega Course.
##  Directories
Each app will be contained in a folder titled "appindexnumber" eg app1, app2,.
Further readmes in each folder to clarify execution installation etc..

## App9
Note that app9 contains a git repo by itself so it has been uploaded seperately.
