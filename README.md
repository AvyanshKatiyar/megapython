# Read me

This is  a repository of 10 apps that I will be building from Ardit Sulce's Python Mega Course.
##  Directories
Each app will be contained in a folder titled "appindexnumber" eg app1, app2,.
Further readmes in each folder to clarify execution installation etc..

Not app code does not contain any apps rather the learning material that was required before the course taught us to build apps.
